1. There is an unsolved problem, or not fully undersatood problem, which is when header has a margin-top, the `body` element will be overflowed. The `body` element not include `header` element's `margin-top` area, which is confusing.
2. The meaning of each value of `box-shadow`.
3. The elements of layout in `index.html` is nested, but the style sheet is separated. It may for the readablity.
